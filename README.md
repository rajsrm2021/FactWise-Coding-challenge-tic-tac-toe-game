# Tik-Tak-Toi Game

## Overview

Developed TIC-TAC-TOI game as a coding exercise for Factwise. This project utilizes React.js for the user interface, Framer Motion for animations, and CSS for styling.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Framer Motion**: A production-ready motion library for React.
- **CSS**: Styling the application for a clean and responsive design.

## How to Play

1. The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
2. Player X always goes first.
3. Players take turns clicking on an empty square to place their mark (X or O).
4. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
5. If all nine squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is considered a draw.
